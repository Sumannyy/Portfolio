          <h3>Project 1</h3>
          <p>
            A simple and clean portfolio website to showcase personal projects
            and skills. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features
            interactive navigation, smooth scrolling, and a contact form for
            easy communication. Designed to be responsive, the portfolio
            provides an overview of professional experiences, a gallery of
            completed projects, and a brief about section. It’s a great way to
            highlight my work and connect with potential collaborators or
            employers.
